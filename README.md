# Applied Data Science Capstone Project
This is the final assignment of the specialization, the final 10th course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 

For this assignment I had 2 parts to complete based on the subject chosen by me. 

**Part 1:**
- A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. 
- A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. 

**Part 2:**
A full report consisting of all of the following components:
- Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.
- Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
- Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical -testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
- Results section where you discuss the results.
- Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
- Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

I've chosen to identify the best borough in London to visit after the lockdown restriction are lifted. 

## My analysis followed the steps:
- web-scraping borough information from Wikipedia
- data pre-processing
- feature selection
- feature engineering
- getting location data using ArcGis
- processing the location data
- building a map visualization of London
- using Foursquare API to collect information about establishments in the area 
- grouped venues by category
- selected top 10 categories for clustering
- used KMeans to cluster the data 

The project will be redone including presentation and report in order to improve my work and show the progress with version 2.
